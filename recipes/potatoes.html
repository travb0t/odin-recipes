            <h2>Why this recipe?</h2>
            <p>These are like a baked potato, but better! This recipe is so simple and
            makes a delicious side dish, a 'baked' potato that is soft in the middle
            and perfectly grilled on the outside. We dip ours in sour cream and green
            onions!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large russet potatoes, scrubbed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step by step:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Poke each potato with the tines of a fork. Place the potatoes in a
                microwave oven, and cook on high power for about 5 minutes. Check about
                halfway through, and turn potatoes over for even cooking. Slice each
                potato in half the long way and cook potatoes another 2 minutes on high power.</li>
                <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat.</li>
                <li>Brush the potato tops with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Cook on prepared grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once.</li>
            </ol>
